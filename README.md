# B-ALL Foundation Model: Multi-Sample ATAC-seq Genetic Screening Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for in-silico genetic screening of ATAC-seq peaks across multiple B-ALL (B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) samples using the CoRIGAMI foundation model.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project performs genetic screening on **155 B-ALL samples** using:
- **ATAC-seq peaks** from each individual sample
- **CTCF binding data** (log2 fold change)
- **CoRIGAMI foundation model** for chromatin structure prediction
- **Unified peakome** created from all samples with overlap removal

## 📊 Data Files

**⚠️ Important**: Due to GitHub's file size limits, the BED files are not included in this repository. You need to obtain them separately.

### Required BED Files (Not in Repository)
- **Individual Sample Peaks**: 155 GSM files in `peaks/` directory
  - Each file contains ATAC-seq peaks for one sample
  - Format: BED4 (chr, start, end, peak_id)
  - Typical range: 100,000-150,000 peaks per sample
  - Example: `peaks/GSM6481643.peaks.bed` (113,449 peaks)

- **Unified Peakome**: `unified_peakome_1kb_no_overlaps.bed`
  - Created from all 155 samples
  - Contains 191,876 unique peaks after overlap removal
  - Used for screening across all samples

### How to Obtain BED Files
The peak files derive from patient B-ALL ATAC-seq samples (GEO `GSM*` accessions) and are too large for GitHub; they are not redistributed here.
You can still exercise the full pipeline:
1. **Regenerate them from your own ATAC-seq peak calls** with the Python scripts in this repository (below), or **contact the authors** for access to the originals.
2. **Validate the pipeline without the full dataset** using the included test scripts (`test_pipeline.sh`, `test_single_sample.sh`).
3. **Use the Python scripts** in this repository to generate them:
   ```bash
   # Generate individual peak files from your ATAC-seq data
   python create_unified_peakome.py
   
   # This will create both individual sample peaks and the unified peakome
   ```

### Sample List
- `samples.txt` contains sample names
- One sample per line
- Comments start with `#`

## 🔬 Scientific Background

### B-ALL Foundation Model
The CoRIGAMI foundation model has been trained on B-ALL chromatin structure data and can predict:
- Chromatin accessibility changes
- Transcription factor binding effects
- Regulatory element perturbations

### Multi-Sample Approach
- **155 B-ALL samples** with individual ATAC-seq data
- **Sample-specific genomic features** (CTCF, ATAC bigwigs)
- **Shared model parameters** for consistency
- **Unified peakome** for comprehensive coverage

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- SLURM cluster access
- CoRIGAMI environment (`conda activate corigami_ball`)
- Access to genomic data files
- **BED files** (see Data Files section above)

### 2. Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/javrodriguez/ISGS_BALL.git
cd ISGS_BALL

# Obtain the required BED files (see Data Files section)
# Place them in the correct locations:
# - Individual peaks: peaks/GSM*.peaks.bed
# - Unified peakome: unified_peakome_1kb_no_overlaps.bed

# Update paths in the configuration
cd ISGS/src
# Edit run_multi_sample_screening.sh with your paths
```

### 3. Validate Setup
```bash
cd ISGS/src
./test_pipeline.sh
```

### 4. Run Pipeline
```bash
./run_multi_sample_screening.sh
```

## 🔧 Pipeline Components

### Main Scripts
1. **`multi_sample_scheduler.sh`** - Main orchestrator
   - Processes samples sequentially
   - Generates sample-specific scripts
   - Manages HPC resources

2. **`run_multi_sample_screening.sh`** - User-friendly wrapper
   - Path validation
   - User confirmation
   - Job submission

3. **`test_pipeline.sh`** - Validation script
   - Checks file existence
   - Validates sample data
   - Reports readiness status

### Generated Scripts (per sample)
- `screen_<sample>.sh` - Peak-level processing
- `job_scheduler_<sample>.sh` - Batch-level processing

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

```
multi_sample_scheduler.sh (Main)
├── job_scheduler_<sample>.sh (Sample-level)
    ├── screen_<sample>.sh (Peak-level)
        └── corigami-screen (Individual peak)
```

### Resource Management
- **Sequential Processing**: Samples processed one at a time
- **Batch Processing**: 1000 peaks per batch
- **Array Jobs**: SLURM array jobs for parallelization
- **Wait Mechanisms**: Each level waits for completion

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Required Paths
Update these in `ISGS/src/run_multi_sample_screening.sh`:
```bash
BEDFILE="../unified_peakome_1kb_no_overlaps.bed"
SAMPLES_FILE="../samples.txt"
INPUT_DIR="/path/to/genomic/data"
MODEL_PATH="/path/to/corigami/model.ckpt"
SEQ_PATH="/path/to/dna/sequence"
```

### Directory Structure
```
<input_dir>/
├── <sample_name>.dd-maxATAC_prepare/
│   └── <sample_name>.dd_IS_slop20_RP20M_minmax01.bw
└── <sample_name>.dd-maxATAC-predict/
    └── maxatac_predict.bw
```

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Timing Estimates
- **Per sample**: 4-8 hours (depending on HPC load and ~100-150k peaks per sample)
- **Total time**: 3-4 weeks for 155 samples
- **Storage**: ~200-400GB total output

### Resource Requirements
- **Multi-sample scheduler**: 2GB, gpu4_long/gpu8_long
- **Job scheduler**: 2GB, gpu4_long/gpu8_long
- **Screen jobs**: 10GB, gpu4_short/gpu4_medium/gpu8_short/gpu8_medium

## 🔍 Analysis Scripts

### Python Scripts
- `create_unified_peakome.py` - Creates unified peakome from individual samples
- `analyze_peakome.py` - Analyzes peakome characteristics
- `analyze_overlaps.py` - Analyzes peak overlaps between samples
- `analyze_score_comparability.py` - Compares scores across samples
- `demonstrate_overlap_removal.py` - Demonstrates overlap removal process

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing BED files**: Ensure you have obtained the required BED files
2. **Missing genomic features**: Check file paths in `samples.txt`
3. **SLURM job failures**: Check log files in `logs-*/` directories
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x *.sh`)

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Test with single sample
echo "BALL-MCG001" > test_samples.txt
./test_single_sample.sh
```
